# Dungeon Escape VR

​Single-Player VR puzzle escape game developed using Unreal Engine 4, C++. Dungeon Escape VR was a solo project originally created as a non-VR game. I converted the game to VR adding the gameplay mechanics for a VR experience. This game uses SteamVR.


### Project Specifications
-  Single player VR
- Developed in UE 4.25​
- C++


### Project Goals
- Learn about VR development in UE
- Learn about VR gameplay mechanics



## Game 
​Dungeon Escape VR originally was part of a tutorial I completed when first learning Unreal Engine. The original project can be found on itch.io here, [Dungeon Escape]. When I started with VR development I decided to take the existing game, which was not VR and create a VR version. My goal was to learn about the design and gameplay implementations that differ from a flat screen 3D game. This simple game seemed like the perfect fit.

The objective of the game is the same as the original, escape from a medieval dungeon. In the dungeon there are cell doors, statues that act as keys, and triggers for opening the cell doors. The player must place the keys on the triggers in the correct combinations, opening the cell doors to escape from the dungeon.
